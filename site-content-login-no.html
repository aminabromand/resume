        <p>
            I am a confident, intelligent, creative man enjoying this amazing life.
            I am honest, reliable and straightforward.
            I am optimistic and usually smiling. I am tender.
            I will laugh with you, and I will cry with you.
            I have been told I am funny, unique and charming.
            When I was younger I suppose I was a bit arrogant and full of myself.
            I am older now and I think I know myself better and understand my responsibility in relation to others.
            Perhaps arrogance has become confidence.
